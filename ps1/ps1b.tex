\section{Problem \#1}
\subsection{Part A}
\emph{Under the assumption of random assignment conditional on the observables, what are the sources of misspecification bias in the estimates generated by the linear model estimated in Problem Set 1a?}

\paragraph{Wrong functional form.}
In Problem Set 1A we used linear (i.e., $ y = \beta x + \epsilon$) estimators to make ``corrections'' while the true functional form of the relationships between the covariates we included in the modern were certainly not linear.  By imposing a linear function on a non-linear data generating process (described by the CEF), we introduce misspecification bias in the model.  

\paragraph{Omitted Variables Bias.}  We were able to use variables included in the dataset in our linear model, but not the unobserved variables that may be important for control.  If omitted variables exist that both determine outcomes related to birth weight and are correlated with smoking status we will over- or under-estimate the effect (depending on the characteristics of the omission).   


\subsection{Part B}
\emph{Now, consider a series estimator. Estimate the smoking effects using a flexible functional form for the control variables (e.g., higher order terms and interactions). What are the benefits and drawbacks to this approach?}

We can attempt to reduce the magnitude of the first source of bias mentioned above (Functional Form) by introducing non-parametric series estimators as a replacement for linear regression.  

\section{Problem \#2}

The Propensity Score Method (PSM) uses a ``surrogate" normalized metric (p-score) as a replacement for the observable controls that would normally be used to condition the estimates of a treatment response to the variable in question.  The p-score is defined as a normalized score that represents the likelihood a sample selects into treatment conditioned on observables.  Because it collapses all the dimensions into a 0:1 continuum PSM avoids the curse of dimensionality encountered with large nonparametric regression models, where it can be difficult to find neighbors or ``bandwidth-mates" in n-dimensional space.  

\subsection{Part A}

To calculate the propensity score, we estimated a logit model of mother's tobacco use (0=non-smoker, 1=smoker) as determined by the predetermined covariates shown in Table \ref{tab:propensities}. Model \#1 shows the full model using all of the covariates suspected to be predetermined. Model \#2 is a reduced form of the same model, preserving just those covariates that were significant at the 1\% level in Model \#1.

To test whether the propensity scores predicted by these two models are significantly different  we perform a likelihood ratio test between  the full and reduced model. This test yields the following output:

%The estimated average treatment effect is given by 
%$\delta_1 + \delta_2 \overbar{p}(X_i)=-237.099 + (0.1594*90.427)=-222.69$

%This suggests that (pursuant to these assumptions) the average effect of smoking on birthweight is a reduction of 223 grams.
