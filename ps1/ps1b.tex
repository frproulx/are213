\section{Problem \#1}
\subsection{Part A}
\emph{Under the assumption of random assignment conditional on the observables, what are the sources of misspecification bias in the estimates generated by the linear model estimated in Problem Set 1a?}

I think this is referring to the covariance between smoking and age.




\subsection{Part B}
\emph{Now, consider a series estimator. Estimate the smoking effects using a flexible functional form for the control variables (e.g., higher order terms and interactions). What are the benefits and drawbacks to this approach?}


\section{Problem \#2}
\subsection{Part A}

To calculate the propensity score, we estimated a logit model of mother's tobacco use (0=non-smoker, 1=smoker) as determined by the predetermined covariates shown in Table \ref{tab:propensities}.

\input{propensityscores.tex}

To test whether the propensity scores are comparable we perform a likelihood ratio test between the full and reduced model. 

NOTE from class: including insignificant terms can be beneficial in terms of getting better fit (by reducing 



\subsection{Part B}

This estimation assumes unconfoundedness. and conditional indpendence

\input{propensityscoremodel.tex}

The estimated average treatment effect is given by 
\begin{align*}
\delta_1 + \delta_2 \overbar{p}(X_i)=
 -237.099 + (0.1594*90.427)=
-222.69
\end{align*}

This suggests that (pursuant to these assumptions) the average effect of smoking on birthweight is a reduction of 223 grams.

\subsection{Part C}





We used R to complete this assignment.  The code is below:
